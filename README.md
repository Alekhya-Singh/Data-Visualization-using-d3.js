# Data-Visualization-using-d3.js

A lot of things have happened in the last century. A couple of world wars accompanied by the cold war, landing on the moon, the invention of the Internet, the increase in the human life expectancy, the formation of new nations and the changes in the types of government are the key highlights of the 20th century.

The way the world operates and the way people live today is quite different than the way it used to be 100 years ago.

I am illustrating a story here of how things looked way back in the 1900s and how things are today. When you see the changes took place in the entire story gives you a platform to launch multiple scenarios of what could have had happened.

I will help to visualize a dataset of 10 columns which has 80k rows. This dataset has the data of the last 100 years for each country that mainly includes its population, its GDP and average life expectancy.

The increase in the population of the world had its impact on the entire world in the last 100 years.

### Dataset

###### Selection/Source of Dataset

    • The dataset used here is provided by gapmider:https://www.gapminder.org/

    • The CSV file is crafted to obtain the features (columns) from multiple dataset-CSV files.

    • This is done in order to visualize the GDP per capita vs. average life expectancy against the population of the countries.

    • Additionally other features like Regions, Governments are included in a single CSV sheet to address the purpose of this visualization.
